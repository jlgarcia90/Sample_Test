# Sample_Test

#Intro

Hi,

I will be attempting to create a web application to take information in, and use VGS to secure the data. I will admit that I have not created a web applicattion from scratch. Most of my experience has been based off a working sample, and building it up from there. The way I plan to do this is the following:

1. Create a local host for the site to live at
  -install/use wamp and phpmyadmin to act as the server
2. Display a page to ask for input card data and save the data to send to another site to charge the card
  -the form will ask for bare minimal to make a payment
3. Use VGS to secure the data before transmission and be able to decrpyt it

Let us give this a whirl. 

Best,

JL

#Items Needed

Please install Wamp onto your computer. I will be using Wamp to run my site locally.
